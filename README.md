# README

A Rails app starter template for my own use. It includes:

## Rails version
- Always use the --main branch of Rails. Yes, main.


## The web part:

### Icons
Use SVG icons from Google Material Icons. [Material Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline)
Having an icons.svg file in the assets/images folder as the single source for icons.
All icons share a standard CSS class name `icon` and a specific class name for each icon.
Using icons in ERB with my partial way or my icon_helper way.

Never use Tailwind or something, just pure vanilla modern CSS3.

### JavaScript
Use StimulusJS for the JavaScript part. [StimulusJS](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/)
